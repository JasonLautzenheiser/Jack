	say "[Story Title] was created originally for the EctoComp13 and was created in under 3 hours in Inform 7.  Inform 7 is the work of Graham Nelson.  The first release was quickly beta-tested by my son Trey Lautzenheiser, who doesn't normally play IF, but offered some valuable advice.  I've since expanded the game into something a bit more fleshed out.  Hope you enjoy.

In wonderment you notice your hands for the first time and see straw coming out of your sleeves as well.  As you stare at your hands you notice a strange glow seemingly coming from within you.  You start to run your fingers through your hair only to realize you have none.  As you stand there in shock over what you've become you realize you have nothing but vague memories of a time before the pumpkin patch.  You look around and see large pumpkins that seem to have the same shape as your head.  It all comes flooding back to you.....you are Jack....Jack Halloween.";
