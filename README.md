Inform 7 Game - Originally an entry in EctoComp 2013.

#### Update
9/1/2020 - Created an Inform 6 version of this project.  Mainly to learn Inform 6, but also that is where I'll be finishing the story started here.  You can check that repo out at https://github.com/JasonLautzenheiser/Jack-I6


8/25/2020 - Open sourced the project and beginning to make some updates to try and finish this up.   In it's EctoComp form, it was rushed and incomplete.  However, while going back and reviewing some of the reviews it actually got some favorable feedback and people were hoping to see it polished up.  So I'm gonna attempt to do that now.

#### Background

Since it's initial release in 2013 for the EctoComp competition, I've sporadically toyed with this one and added things here and there, though nothing concrete and nothing in over a year as of this writing (October 2015).  Since then I've improved my coding quite a bit and have learned so much about game development / design that I thought I'd come back to my very first release and try and improve upon it.

#### Current State

10/5/2015 - I make no promises on the current state / playability of this.  It does compile in Inform7 6L38 and should be able to play through, though I'm sure it's buggy, has plenty of issues and unimplemented items.  So take it for what it truly is...a work in progress.

#### Future plans

Overall I have plans to expand upon the simple premise of this and while the original version release for the competition had some violent moments, it was relatively light in nature.  The over-arching story that this 3-hour experiment was based on is however much, much darker.  I want to bring that out.  I'm sure some will be offended, but don't tell me I didn't warn you.

Beyond the story, this will be largely a complete rewrite.  The early checkins will be of course basically what was released for the competition, but moving forward, no code is sacred and I'll hack away mercilessly as I feel I'm much improved (nowhere near as competitent as the I7 wizards out there) and this has a lot of room for improvements.

If you're really interested in the progress or future plans, take a look at the issues as I'll hopefully be using that as my main TODO list.

This will come nowhere close to being a great story, but I do hope it's somewhat enjoyable in it's own 'campy' horror fashion.  Enjoy it for what it is, not for what it is not trying to be.
